# Contributing

This repository prioritizes reproducibility, traceability, and auditability.

## Language policy (strict)

All repository artifacts are English-only:

- Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `reports/*.md`)
- Notebooks (`notebooks/*.ipynb`)
- Code documentation (docstrings, comments where present)
Commit messages are English-only.

Team communication may be in Spanish, but technical terms and artifact names must be referenced in English (e.g., drivers, deliverables, acceptance criteria, unit of analysis).

## Commit message convention

We use Conventional Commits to keep history searchable and auditable:

- docs: Documentation only
- data: Data acquisition, ingestion, validation, processing
- feat: New functionality
- fix: Bug fix
- refactor: Refactoring without behavior change
- test: Add/update tests
- chore: Maintenance (deps, tooling)

Examples:

- docs: add language policy to project contract
- docs: add driver-observable mapping table
- data: add SAIH-ROEA station metadata ingestion scaffold
- chore: add pre-commit configuration

## Pull request checklist

- The change is reproducible (no manual steps hidden).
- Raw data is not edited manually; derived data is generated by code.
- Outputs are saved under `reports/` and are regenerable.
- English-only policy is respected across modified files.
